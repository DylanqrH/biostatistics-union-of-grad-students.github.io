  text: The Biostatistics Union<br> of Graduate Students (BUGS) was founded by biostatistics students for biostatistics students. Our mandate is to represent the interests of the students within our department and the school, as well as to provide a sense of community for our students. Our executive is made up of student volunteers and our monthly meetings are open to all students who wish to help out. <br>BUGS and the department encourage students to have work-life balance. In this respect, BUGS holds various social events throughout the year to encourage students to take some time out of their coursework for a little fun. In the past, we have organized various social events for both the students and faculty, including picnics, potlucks, board game/movie nights and Halloween/holiday parties.
